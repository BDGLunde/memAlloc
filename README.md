# memAlloc
Simple implementation of malloc using an implicit free-list with support for splitting and immediate coalescing of adjacent free blocks. Used as one of the student projects for <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/courses/354">CS 354</a> at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

I am waiting for the project grades to be submitted before uploading the project files, since it is my understanding that doing so before the project is graded is considered academic dishonesty. If you are a faculty member of UW-Madison's CS department and still find this to be in violation of policy, please let me know.
